# BraTs2020 MRI Scan Segmentation Project

## Overview

Welcome to the BraTs2020 MRI Scan Segmentation project! This project focuses on segmenting brain tumors in 3D MRI scans using the 3D U-Net architecture. Additionally, the project includes a feature to generate a GIF showcasing the segmentation process, followed by calculating the volume of the tumor in cubic centimeters.
